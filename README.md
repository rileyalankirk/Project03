Project03

Project03 simulates a food truck moving through a neighborhood delivering random orders. The current model permits for the comparison of different route calculations which then can be compared to discover the cost-effectiveness of each route.

The file structure is as follows:
* files
	* The files directory stores all the files that the simulation will access, as expected
* Simulation
	* All Java source code files that generate the simulation are stored in the Simulation package
* Sprint (Requirements, Backlog, and UML)
	* All requirements, backlog, and UML diagrams from each sprint are stored within this directory
